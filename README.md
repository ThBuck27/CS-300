# CS-300
Portfolio Submission for CS-300

What problem were you solving in this project?
This project involved developing an advising assistance program for ABCU’s Computer Science department. The goal was to help advisors and students easily access course information and prerequisites. The program needed to load data from a CSV file, store it efficiently, and let users view a sorted course list or look up individual courses.

How did you approach the problem?
I selected data structures that matched the program’s needs for speed and simplicity. An unordered_map provided quick lookups by course ID, while a vector handled sorting for the full course list. My focus was on building a clear, efficient solution that reflected good software design rather than unnecessary complexity.

How did you overcome roadblocks?
Challenges included managing variable CSV formats and ensuring error handling for missing files. I solved this by writing a custom string-splitting and trimming function and testing input thoroughly. Another hurdle was aligning my output with the sample program’s formatting, which I resolved through repeated testing and small adjustments.

How has this project expanded your approach to software design?
This project showed how early design choices—like selecting the right data structure—directly affect performance and clarity. It also reinforced the value of breaking down a problem into smaller, modular functions that are easy to test and maintain.

How has this project evolved your programming style?
I’ve become more intentional about writing clean, readable, and adaptable code. Using clear names, consistent comments, and structured logic made the program easier to understand and extend. I also learned that maintainable code isn’t just functional—it’s reliable, user-friendly, and easy to build upon.
